        "\n",
        "**Resources:** These include assets and resources such as images, icons, layout files, and XML files that define the user interface and other application resources. These are typically located in the \"res\" directory within the APK.\n",

        "**Libraries:** If the application includes native code written in C or C++, you will find shared libraries in the \"lib\" directory within the APK. These are specific to different CPU architectures and Android versions.\n",

        "**Assets:** This directory may contain additional resources or files that the application needs. These assets can be read by the application at runtime.\n",
